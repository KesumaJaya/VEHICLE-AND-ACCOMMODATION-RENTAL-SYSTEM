<h1>VEHICLE AND ACCOMMODATION RENTAL SYSTEM</h1>

<strong>CSC186 - OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING</strong>

The Vehicle and Accommodation Rental System is a platform for a vehicle and accommodation company to advertise their services. The system allows users to browse a menu of listed companies, select a vehicle or accommodation, specify the rental duration, and view a receipt on the screen with the calculated details. This process is the same for both vehicle and accommodation services. Every time booking and renting occured, the system will generates a report that is stored in a designated folder.
